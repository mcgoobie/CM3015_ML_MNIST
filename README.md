# CM3015_ML_MNIST
MNIST Dataset classification using dense neural networks

This problems in this project is tackled using Chollet's universal workflow of machine learning from Deep Learning with Python (Chp 4.5).
Tensorflow's MNIST dataset is used to conduct a multiclass binary classification and find the model for the task. This was done by establishing a 
baseline model's performance, comparing it to an overfitted model and finally using regularization techniques such as dropouts, adding/removing layers, 
L1 and L2 Regularization etc. to find the best model.
